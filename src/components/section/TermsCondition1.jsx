                  minutes but more than two (2) hours before the appointment,
                  you will be charged a $10.00 cancellation fee. If you cancel
                  less than two (2) hours before the appointment you have
                  scheduled, you will be charged the full price of the job you

                  <b>Licensing -</b>&nbsp;We confirm at the time of a service
                  professional business' application, that a prospective new SP
                  business has any applicable required state-level trade
                  licensing for the services for which we match them to
                  consumers. Certain states may require state-level licensing
                  for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you
                  confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the
                  applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some
                  states, licensing may be required by the county or local
                  authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend
                  you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding
                  with your project. Larger projects often require the use of
                  sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a
                  kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We
                  recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work
                  on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the
                  unique nature of California licensing, SpeakMyDialect relies
                  on representations of service professionals that are using a
                  California General building contracting license to cover
                  vehicle improvement tasks that such service professionals are
                  performing more than one task as defined and required by
                  California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask
                  the business to provide you with a copy of their license.

                  <b>Criminal Records Search -</b>&nbsp;We use third party data
                  sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which
                  the owner/principal of the company is located, for any
                  relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal
                  of the business, within the three years prior to such service
                  professional's application for membership in the
                  SpeakMyDialect network. SpeakMyDialect?s third-party vendor
                  uses a national criminal database ("NCD") to screen our
                  service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies
                  by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is
                  particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA,
                  ID, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA,
                  VT, and WY.&nbsp;

                  <b>Sex Offender Search -</b>&nbsp;We check the websites that
                  consolidate state sex offender information in the state in
                  which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm
                  that there is not a match based solely on the name of the
                  owner/principal of the company. We do not run sex offender
                  searches in any other states. Please note that only a
                  fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex
                  offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable
                  state sex offender websites for any individuals that will be
                  performing work in your vehicle.

                    Angie's List has criminal background checks performed
                    annually on the principal/owner or relevant manager of all
                    "A"- and "B"-rated companies that are Certified Service
                    Providers, that offer ecommerce offers, that receive leads
                    through the Projects Submissions platform, or that are
                    granted the Super Service Award. The background check
                    currently is performed by American Business Services
                    ("ABS"), a third-party screening company. Upon processing
                    the background check, ABS will provide Angie's List with a
                    simple "pass" or "fail" designation. A failed background
                    check is one that finds one or more of the following: (1)
                    any violent or theft conviction at a felony level in the
                    last 7 years; (2) any sexual felony conviction or on a
                    sexual offender registry at any time (no time limit); or (3)
                    any pending felony charges involving any of types (1) or
                    (2).

                    ABS will provide Angie's List with only a pass or fail
                    designation. Angie's List and its members will never see any
                    content from background check results. Since we can only
                    perform these background checks annually, we ask anyone with

                  By using the Website and/or SpeakMyDialect's services in any
                  manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing

                  any claims between you and SpeakMyDialect. YOU ALSO GIVE UP
                  YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS
                  PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL
                  ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair
                  hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any
                  relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration
                  proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than
                  trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the
                  arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a
                  court only for very limited reasons. For details on the
                  arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.

                arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms
                and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such

                titles in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and
                have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms and Conditions
                are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado as such laws

                entirely in the State of Colorado and between Colorado
                residents. You agree to submit to jurisdiction in Colorado and
                that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms and
                Conditions will be brought solely in a court in Denver County,
